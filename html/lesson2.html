            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p2>This method should take roughly around 60 minutes to prep and 30 minutes to bake.</p2>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Butter and line a 20 x 30cm rectangle tin.</li>
                                </ul>
                <li>Step 2</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Beat the butter and sugar in a free-standing mixer until pale and fluffy.<br> Add the eggs one at a time and beat well. Beat through the flour, milk and salt until fully combined, then spoon into the tin.<br> Bake in the oven for 25 mins or until golden and firm to the touch. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
                                </ul>
                <li>Step 3</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Slice the sponge horizontally to create two halves. Trim the edges to make perfect corners.<br>Cut the sponge into 18 squares. Lightly whip the cream with the icing sugar until it reaches soft peaks. <br>Spread a little of the jam on half of the sponge squares then pipe or spread over a little of the cream. <br>Sandwich each one with a second square of sponge then set aside in the fridge to chill.</li>
                                </ul>
                <li>Step 4</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To make the icing, whisk together the melted butter and milk in a bowl.<br> Sieve the cocoa powder and icing sugar together in a seperate bowl. Gradually add the cocoa and sugar to the butter and milk<br>mixture, whisking continuously to ensure there are no lumps. If it gets lumpy, whizz with a hand blender until smooth.</li>
                                </ul>
                <li>Step 5</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Divide the coconut between three shallow bowls (this keeps it from getting coated in too much chocolate whilst you’re dipping).</li>
                                </ul>
                <li>Step 6</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dip each lamington in the icing until completely covered. Roll in the coconut and set on a wire rack.<br> Repeat with the remaining sponges. Chill for a minimum of 1 hr.</li>
                                </ul>
            </ol>
